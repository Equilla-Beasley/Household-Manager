# Household Manager

This Household Manager App was created for the purpose of organizing my personal household and also to learn Rust.

## Introduction

Hello All and welcome to my Household Manager App!

The original idea for this application came when I started to run my own household alongside my Partner, and I realized that instead of using a physical calendar and Whatsapp messages to stay organized on household tasks and bills, I could simply create my own app that would make it straightforward and easy for the both of us.

Since I've also been simultaneously learning Rust, this seemed like the perfect opportunity to combine both goals into one. Hence, this project has started!

## Technologies

This app is created in Rust using RustRover as the IDE.\
**Egui** is the choice of library for displaying graphical elements.\
**Serde** is used to serialize data stored within the app.

## Goals

The Goal of this project is to make a Household Manager app that can cover any needs in regards to maintaining a household. The current list of goals are as follows (though more will eventually be added)

- [ ] A To-Do List for Daily Tasks
- [ ] A Scheduler for Recurring and One-Off Tasks (which will also update the To-Do List)
- [ ] A Budgeter (which will display the current budget and expenditures for a period of time)
- [ ] And More...

## To-Do List

### Description

The To-Do List acts as a quick guide to whatever tasks are currently needing to be done. New tasks can be added directly to the To-Do List, or they will automatically show up on the To-Do List if they were scheduled using the Scheduler.

The goal of this feature is to, at a glance, see what tasks need to be done and be notified of them or to add something to the list that needs to be done relatively soon.
